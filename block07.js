"========================================================================"

// To practice passing data between functions let's create a crypto converterâ€¦
// You need to create several functions, each will be responsible for its own 
// tasks and to call the next function.
// addCurrency
// findcurrency
// converter
// tellConversion
// You should exclusively call addCurrency and it will call the others
// add currency takes three arguments 
// a coin, its value (amount of coins) and an array of coins (our coins database)
// the coin should be an object with the following structure:

// {
//      coin:'coin_here', 
//      rate:CONVERSION_RATE_TO_USD_TYPE_NUMBER
// }

//======================  EXAMPLE  ========================
// Here {coin:'bitcoin', rate:8000} is your coin, 2 is a value/amount, crypt is the name of your DB
// First time you run it should return "New coin Bitcoin added to Database"
// Second time you run it the return should be "You will receive 16000 usd for your 2 Bitcoins"

// addCurrency should first check if the coin already exists in the DB and if it doesn't it should 
// add it on and return the following:
// "New coin {YOUR_NEW_ADDED_COIN_GOES_HERE} added to Database"
// If the coin does exist in the DB it should call findcurrency which should retrieve the conversion 
// rate of the given currency and then passing that should call convert 
// which is in charge of doing the actual conversion.
// However it is TellConversion which is in charge to return the final message to the user.
// "You will receive {AMOUNT} usd for your 2 {COINS_NAME}"
// Please make sure that when adding the new currency the output message capitalize the coin name.

var crypt = []
addCurrency({coin:'bitcoin', rate:8000}, 2, crypt)

// crypt = [{coin:'bitcoin', rate:8000}]

// Create a constructor function called bankAccount, which has 3 methods:
// withdraw which takes away from the account balance, 
// deposit which adds to it,
// and balance which returns the balance.
// all of these three are functions, using amount to increase/decrease or display the balance
// all of them are inside your BankAccount class

"========================================================================"

// Implement a representation of the universe where matter and energy is conserved. 
// To do so implement one object called Universe that contains two objects within: 
// matter and energy. If matter is destroyed; that is say we call Universe.matter.destroy(5), 
// then the amount of energy in the universe needs to be increased so that if we call 
// Universe.energy.total() we should obtain a total value of energy that has increased +5 
// compared to the energy value previous to calling Universe.matter.destroy(5). 
// Of course the total amount of matter obtained by calling Universe.matter.total()has been 
// reduced by 5 compared to the initial value.
//   - Implement this objects using context
//   - The matter and energy objects are defined within an object called Universe
//   - No other variable should be defined out of the Universe object
//   - Also implement the create methods for both matter an energy which are opposite to 
//     their counterparts
//   - You should be able to give an initial amount to either the energy or the matter, 
//     otherwise should default to 0.
    
//======================  EXAMPLE  ========================
var universe = new Universe(10, 'matter')
universe.matter.total // 10 
universe.energy.total // 0 

// or with no initial amount 
var universe = new Universe()
universe.matter.total // 0 
universe.energy.total // 0 
universe.matter.destroy(5) // 0 
universe.matter.total // -5 
universe.energy.total // 5 
universe.energy.destroy(-5) // 0 
universe.matter.total // -10 
universe.energy.total // 10 
universe.energy.create(5) // 0 
universe.matter.total // -15 
universe.energy.total // 15 
//=========================================================

// Notes: Initially make your universe contain 0 matter and energy.  
// Destroying a negative amount of energy of matter is equal to creating 
// a positive amount of each and vice versa for creating matter or energy.

"===================  EXERCISE 7 - Humans invasion  ====================="
"========================================================================"

// No tests for this one since it will be using a random choice for the battle ðŸ¤ª

/*
As we run out or resources on Earth we are planning an invasion on planet Otatop 
which seems to have very suitable atmosphere for us. But there is a tiny problem -- it 
is already inhibitit by some local creatures. And they are willing to protect it 
from us (how dare they!).
So we assemled an army of stormtroopers willing to defeat and conquer. 
First battle is happening on Otatop, if we defeat them there -- war is over!!!
If not, next battle is one step closer to Earth, on the SuperNova13! From there, if those annoying aliens 
will defeat us, the battle is moving to Z666, and so on. If we win a battle we are moving to the next battle in the opposite direction toward Otapop.
Losing on Earth means end of game for us. 
So the race losing the battle on their home planet lose the game and seize to exist. 
Alternatively, the army first to perish completely also means kaput for the player 
and end game. If unit is perished completely, it can't go to the next battle, duh.

For every battle for simplicty we randomly pick units from both armies and throw them 
into the fight, the unit winning determines the results fo the battle, also based on 
the damage caused we count how many opposite units are dead. 
*/ 

// Example data:

let locations = ['Earth','Moon','Z666','SuperNova13','Otatop']
let humans = [
{unit:'karateMasters', qty: 3000, strength: 5, rateOfFire: 20, stamina: 10},
{unit:'teslaTanks', qty: 50, strength: 100, rateOfFire: 5, stamina: 100},
{unit:'bostonDynamicsSpot', qty: 200, strength: 50, rateOfFire: 15, stamina: 60}
]
let aliens = [
{unit:'motherLord', qty: 1, strength: 500, rateOfFire: 50, stamina: 300},
{unit:'yellowCreature', qty: 250, strength: 200, rateOfFire: 6, stamina: 90},
{unit:'slimyThing', qty: 2500000, strength: 3, rateOfFire: 30, stamina: 7}
]

/* Example of calculating damage/loss:

If we have
 {unit:'karateMasters',qty: 3000, strength: 10, rateOfFire: 1, stamina: 2} going into battle the damage would be 3000 * 10 * 1 = 30 000 

And form another army we have
{unit:'slimyThing', qty: 2500, strength: 12, rateOfFire: 20, stamina: 100} their damage would be 2500 * 12 * 20 = 600 000 

karateMaster stamina is 2, so slimyThing dealing damage of 600 000 would kill 600 000 / 2  = 300 000, 
karateMasters they will perish completely in this battle bringing their qty to -297 000 and canâ€™t go to the next battle

Damage of 30 000 from karateMasters will kill 30 000 / 100 = 300 slimyThings bringing their qty down to 2200 so they suffered damage but still can go to the next battle in a qty of 2200
