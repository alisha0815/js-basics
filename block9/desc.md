# 5-digit calculator

With only HTML, CSS and pure JS you have to create a web page with a form and 5 inputs, they could be alfanumeric and a button "Calculate". If one of the values entered is not a number than you should display a message "One or more inputs contain an invalid data". If all the data entered is numbers then display a green message saying "All the inputs are valid". 

Then, there should be the sorting panel with these 5 values and math action between them: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`. These actions should be applied to the 5 values entered by user. In the same output area there is a sorting feature to sort the numeric values in ascending or descending order. Every time we cahnge the order the final results are also changing. 

Finally there is a third section there we can see the results of these operations.
